Here, In snapshots, I have shown all the admissible trajectories for King.
But, In other pieces, I have shown Array of DOCK items. even for a simple case, in admissible trajectories will be a lot except for the king.
So, I have shown DOCK elements for all the pieces.
For shortest trajectories, I have shown the shortest distance on all the shortest paths. 
For admissible trajectories, there is separate file.


Please let me know in case of any changes.

Thanks,
Darpan Shah
